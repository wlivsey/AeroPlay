# AeroPlay Merge Plan

## Development Summary

Crystal successfully created the following components across different sessions:

### 1. ✅ UI Development (aeroplay3-1 branch)
**Files Created**: 13 files, 2,832 lines
- All 5 screens (Home, PreFlight, InFlight, Games, ParentDashboard)
- Navigation setup (AppNavigator)
- Common components (SafeAreaView, ThemedText, LoadingSpinner)
- InFlight components (LandmarkCard, WindowAlert)
- Main App.tsx with proper initialization

### 2. ✅ Backend Services (feature/backend-services)
**Files Modified**: 3 files
- ESLint configuration
- Test updates for RouteEngine
- Package-lock.json with dependencies

### 3. ✅ Testing & QA (feature/testing-qa)
**Files Created/Modified**: 8 files, 18,815 lines
- App.tsx created
- Expanded RouteEngine tests
- ContentCache service implemented (234 lines)
- Screen implementations (Home, PreFlight, InFlight)
- Package.json updated with all dependencies

### 4. ⚠️ Games Development (feature/games-development)
- No new commits (session may have had issues or is pending)

## Merge Strategy

### Step 1: Merge UI Development (Most Complete)
```bash
git checkout main
git merge aeroplay3-1
```

### Step 2: Merge Testing & QA (Has ContentCache)
```bash
git checkout main
git cherry-pick ca1133ae  # The testing-qa checkpoint
```

### Step 3: Skip Backend Services
- Only has config changes, not core services
- Testing-qa already has ContentCache

### Step 4: Manual Games Implementation
- Games development didn't complete
- Need to manually create the three games later

## Files to Keep

### From UI Development (aeroplay3-1):
- ✅ All screens (5 files)
- ✅ All components (5 files)
- ✅ Navigation setup
- ✅ App.tsx

### From Testing & QA:
- ✅ ContentCache.ts
- ✅ Expanded tests

### Already in Main:
- ✅ RouteEngine.ts
- ✅ Original tests
- ✅ Package.json base

## Post-Merge Tasks

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Implement Missing Components**:
   - NotificationService.ts
   - TTSService.ts
   - DriftManager.ts
   - Game components (LiveryMatcher, StateShapeQuiz, CloudSpotter)

## Expected Result

After merging, AeroPlay will have:
- ✅ Complete UI with all 5 screens
- ✅ Navigation system
- ✅ RouteEngine with tests
- ✅ ContentCache for offline storage
- ✅ Basic app structure ready for Expo
- ⚠️ Missing: Games, Notification, TTS services (to be added)

The app structure will be ready for testing and further development!
